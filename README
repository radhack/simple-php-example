                SIMPLE-PHP-EXAMPLE

What is it?
-----------

SIMPLE-PHP-EXAMPLE is just a quick and dirty tool which HelloSign
API Support reps could use to test some of HelloSign's embedded API
functionality.

How can I use it?
-----------
To run this locally, download (and remember the location), save
your API Key as HS_APIKEY_PROD and one of your client ids as
HS_CLIENT_ID_PROD as environment variables, and spin up a
webserver from this location like this: $ php -S localhost:8080
(you could choose another port if you're already using 8080).

Then you could modify this code locally for any of your tests,
and submit a PR if you want to contribute to this repo.
